## Purpose
Single page app that fetches manga releases in the current week. (Initially wanted to do a whole month's worth of data, but the free tier of Twitter's API only fetches data from the past seven days.)

The main goal of this project was to learn React, Next.js and Typescript.

## Background
As a manga collector, I find it difficult to keep track of when new books come out. Each publisher has their own calendar but it can be a hassle to click through all of their websites (I'm lazy).

Fortunately, the vast majority of manga publishers are very active on Twitter and regularly tweet when new books are released. This page is an attempt to consolidate all this information using the Twitter API.
